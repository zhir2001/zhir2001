The "Sleep Health And Lifestyle" project aims to explore the intricate relationship between sleep patterns, lifestyle choices, and overall health. Sleep plays a pivotal role in maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being, yet it is often neglected in our modern society. This project seeks to delve into various aspects of sleep health, including its physiological mechanisms, the impact of lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise, and the role of Occupation in influencing sleep patterns. By understanding these dynamics, we aim to provide insights and recommendations for optimizing sleep quality and promoting healthier lifestyles.
